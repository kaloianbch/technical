Using any language/framework/library, consume the [SpaceX-API v3](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and implement a simple web app with a UI to display a list of launches. At a minimum it should also have the ability to view details of a specific launch.

## Bonus

- No design guidelines are given, but making use of images provided by the API is a plus
- Using [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a plus (a good starting point is https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Building an interesting feature using the data is a plus

## Example endpoints

- All launches: `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches`
- Latest launch: `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/latest`
- Specific launch `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/67`
